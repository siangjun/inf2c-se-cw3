The bike can have multiple booking at the same time for different DateRanges, the code will reflect that, but the 
	design pattern needs to reflect that
	Bike is not holding bookings for themselves, they are instead holding the date ranges for which they are taken
	The only thing that is holding bookings is server
	And the booking is holding customer and a set of quotes that were booked with this booking

TODOs for the previous courseworks

I don't know if you need function parameters in the design, but I'll be noting what I have added and deviated

cw1 & cw2 static
The server now has no data about bookings (all the relevant data is in the bikes)

cw2 static model

cw2 dynamic model
getQuotes
	isTaken now takes a parameter of query
	matchesQuery now takes query and bike parameters
	
	btw forgot that when there are no found available quotes to extend the query by 3 days each way
