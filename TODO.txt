Make tests for DateRange::overlaps function, that also check the throws

The bike can have multiple booking at the same time for different DateRanges, the code will reflect that, but the 
	design pattern needs to reflect that

Also the Booking does not extend the functionality of Quote, it just has it as data
	(there are problems with initializing the quote inside the Booking,
		have to make a copy, of already a class of which all data is already final)
